## Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1. **Top Profit Makers**
- Identifies the top 5 car makers generating the highest profits.
- Visualization: Bar chart displaying profit distribution among makers.

### 2. **Car Price Trends Over Years**
- Tracks changes in vehicle prices (maximum, average, and minimum) from 2010 to 2025.
- Visualization: Line chart highlighting price fluctuations over time.

### 3. **Vehicle Concentration Map**
- Displays regions with the highest concentration of vehicles.
- Visualization: Geospatial heatmap.

### 4. **Summary Metrics**
- **Maximum Vehicle Value:** $2.4M
- **Average Vehicle Value:** $638.62K
- **Minimum Vehicle Value:** $130K

### 5. **Effect of Power and Torque on Price**
- Analyzes the correlation between vehicle power, torque, and pricing.
- Visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline.

### 6. **Profit Forecast**
- Predicts car makers' profits for the next 3 years.
- Visualization: Line chart with forecasted data.

### 7. **Key Influencers**
- Determines factors that impact vehicle pricing the most, such as:
  - Increase in Max Power (bhp) increases price by $2.02M.
  - Decrease in Engine Capacity (CC) impacts pricing by $559.9K.

### 8. **Detailed Vehicle Information**
- Allows selection of a specific vehicle to view its details (e.g., make, model, engine, price, RPM).
- Visualization: Tree diagram with hierarchical filtering.
